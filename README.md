# GrpcMicroserviceSample

## Description

In this project I have created a set of microservices with an API Gateway that functions as a REST API and Status Service that is mimicking a worker service that could run e.g. within an IoT device. The services are communicating via gRPC using a combination of simple request -> response kind of scenarios as well as client and server streaming.

## What I have done

- [x] Defined proto files for RPC calls and set up gRPC dependencies in a class library
- [x] Created an API Gateway using ASP.NET with multiple controllers to demonstrate gRPC functionalities, including client and server streaming
- [x] Created a service that runs a gRPC server to mimic a worker service that can run e.g. on an IoT device
